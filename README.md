# 🚛 Logistic Owner Operator AI – Proof of Concept (POC)

**📌 Project Type:** Proof of Concept (POC)  
**📍 Location:** United States  
**🧠 Focus:** Data Engineering for Logistics  
**🛠️ Technology Stack:** Python · Web Scraping · ETL · Google Cloud Platform · BigQuery · Data Visualization · AI  

---

## 📘 Project Overview

**Logistic Owner Operator AI** is a **Proof of Concept (POC)** focused on **data engineering** for independent trucking professionals in the U.S., using **artificial intelligence** as a transformative tool.

The main goal is to support **owner-operators** in:

- ✅ Validating brokers and dispatchers.  
- 💲 Optimizing costs.  
- 🛣️ Increasing route efficiency.

This analysis focuses on vehicle types such as **Cargo Van, Sprinter Van, Box Truck, and Semi Truck (without dry van)**, with payload capacities ranging from **3,600 lb to 26,000 lb**.

In addition, the project incorporates **payment terms and fees** offered by brokers, as these directly impact the operator’s **liquidity and net profitability**:

- **Same Day Payment** – 5% fee  
- **2–3 Business Days** – 3% fee  
- **14 Business Days** – 0% fee  

This will enable comparison of routes, loads, and brokers not only by gross revenue but also by **net income based on payment timing**.

Rather than defining a single “most profitable” unit, this project aims to **identify under what operational conditions each unit type** (Cargo Van, Sprinter, Box Truck, Semi without dry van) achieves **maximum profitability**.

Although all unit types can be profitable, we seek to understand **how, when, and where** they are — based on variables like **payload, load type, mileage, average route pay, delivery time, operating region, and payment terms**.

## 🛠️ Project Goals (POC Data Engineering)

1. 🔍 Validate trustworthy brokers and dispatchers.  
2. 📊 Compare profitability by unit type.  
3. 💸 Evaluate the impact of payment terms on net revenue.  
4. 🛣️ Optimize routes, mileage, and delivery zones.  
5. 🤖 Explore AI use for predictive logistics analysis.

## 💰 Payment Terms Offered by Brokers

Many brokers now offer direct payment options. The following will be analyzed for their **impact on cash flow and true earnings**:

| 💳 Payment Type         | ⏱️ Estimated Time     | 💸 Fee         |
|------------------------|-----------------------|----------------|
| Same Day Payment       | Same day              | 5%             |
| 2–3 Business Days      | 2–3 business days     | 3%             |
| 14 Business Days       | 14 business days      | 0%             |

These terms will be used to calculate **real net revenue** per load.

## 📊 Key Analytical Variables

- Vehicle type (van, box truck, etc.).  
- Load weight and dimensions.  
- Broker/dispatcher offering the load.  
- Operating region or state.  
- Route distance (miles).  
- Rate per mile (USD/mile).  
- Payment term and method.  
- Estimated delivery time.  
- Estimated operational cost (fuel, maintenance, etc.).

---

## 🗂️ Data Sources (Planned)

- Web scraping from broker/freight platforms (e.g., DAT, TruckSmarter).  
- Anonymized real-world load documents.  
- Public logistics APIs.  
- Structured datasets in Google BigQuery.

## 🧱 Web Scraper Phases

### ✅ Phase 1: Structured Block-Based Extraction

In this first phase, we developed a **modular thematic scraper** focused on the **structured extraction of critical data blocks** from the public SAFER FMCSA page, using the **MC Number** as the primary identifier.

🔍 **Main Goal:**  
Retrieve key compliance, operational, and safety data for registered carriers/brokers in the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) system, organized by logical sections.

📦 **Extracted Blocks:**

- 🆔 **Entity Identification:**  
  - Legal Name, DBA Name.  
  - USDOT Number, MC Number.  
  - Physical Address, Mailing Address, Phone.

- 🏢 **Registration Information:**  
  - Entity Type.  
  - USDOT Status.  
  - Operating Authority Status.

- ⚙️ **Operational Classification:**  
  - Operation Classification.  
  - Carrier Operation.

- 📊 **Compliance & Inspections:**  
  - Inspection counts (Vehicle, Driver, Hazmat, IEP).  
  - Out-of-Service % (OOS).  
  - Comparison with national average.

- 🚧 **Crash History:**  
  - Number of incidents (Fatal, Injury, Tow, Total).

- 📋 **Carrier Safety Rating:**  
  - Rating Date, Review Date, Rating, Type.

🛠 **Techniques Used:**

- `Requests` to fetch public HTML content. 
- `BeautifulSoup` to parse the DOM structure.  
- Robust table parsing via `<td>` and class targeting.  
- Clean data aggregation into structured dictionary blocks.  
- JSON export for future use in Data Lakes or ETL pipelines.

✅ This structure enables easy extension of the scraper in future stages, including multi-MC automation, error handling, bulk scraping, and cloud-based storage in BigQuery or Cloud Storage.

---

### 🔜 Phase 2 (in progress): Multi-MC Automation

- Loop through multiple MC Numbers from a list or file  
- Error handling for empty, invalid, or inconsistent entries  
- Logging, retry logic, and dynamic sleeping  
- Upload of parsed data to GCP or cloud-based warehouses

---

## 📈 Expected Outcomes

- Net profitability comparison by vehicle type and payment method.  
- Actionable recommendations for independent carriers.  
- Interactive dashboard (Looker Studio or Python) by state, unit, and broker.  
- Fully documented and reproducible ETL pipeline.  
- Potential future scaling to dry vans and LTL/FTL freight.

## 🤝 Community Impact

This project is inspired by and dedicated to the U.S. independent trucking community, with whom I share real experiences through a Facebook group. Once complete, the findings will be shared with the group to validate results, gather feedback, and support the growth of the community.

This POC aims to be a useful, realistic, and scalable tool to improve decision-making for owner-operators.
